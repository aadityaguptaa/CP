In this question, the main problem is to find the absolute minimum difference. If the constraint of the number of elements was less, then we could have used 2 loops and solved it in O(n^2) time complexity. But since the upper limit is 10^5, we can't.

The key observation here is that the minimum absolute difference must be a difference between two consecutive elements in the sorted array. We can sort the array in O(nlogn) using quick sort or merge sort.

So to find the min difference, we compare adjacent pairs in the sorted array and then just traverse through the vector and print the pairs.
