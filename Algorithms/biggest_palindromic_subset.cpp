/*
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
Example 3:

Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"
Example 4:

Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

/*
In fact, we could solve it in O(n^2) time using only constant space.

We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2nâˆ’1 such centers.

You might be asking why there are 2n - 1 but not nn centers? The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.
